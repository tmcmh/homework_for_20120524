Homework 

Ex: parse a very interesting time using Chronic (a ruby gem), as weird as possible
Display it to the screen


Ex: use Bit.ly gem to shorten a URL relating to you; then, use the "code" part of the URL (e.g.. the "12345" in bit.ly/12345) to return all available info about the URL.

You'll need to get a bitly API key, which should be free.

Ex:  Restaurants!

3 classes 
 Restaurant
 ItalianRestaurant
 ChineseRestaurant

 for all three, say hello in the relevant language, create at least one of each, ask each restaurant if they have bread (true/false), and if they have noodles (true/false)
